# Required Stories for RAG Evaluation Presentation

## Slide: "The Problem" (Introduction)
**Story Purpose**: Demonstrate the real-world impact of poor RAG evaluation
**Story Content**: Share a story about a company that deployed a customer service RAG system without proper evaluation. Initially, it seemed to work well in demos, but over time, customers started complaining about receiving outdated information (like old pricing or discontinued features). The team spent weeks debugging because they couldn't pinpoint where the failures were occurring. The lack of systematic evaluation meant they were "flying blind" - they knew something was wrong but had no systematic way to diagnose the issues. This led to customer frustration, increased support tickets, and ultimately a loss of trust in the AI system.
**Key Message**: Without systematic evaluation, "silent failures" accumulate and erode user trust over time.

## Slide: "Real Example: Wrong Answer Diagnosis" (Failure Funnel)
**Story Purpose**: Walk through a concrete diagnostic process showing the power of the failure funnel
**Story Content**: Tell the story of debugging a specific issue in a company knowledge base RAG system. A user asked "When was our company founded?" and consistently got "2020" instead of the correct "2019". Walk through the actual debugging process: First, they checked if the founding date information was split across chunks (it wasn't). Then they verified the information was indexed and searchable (it was). Next, they checked if the retrieval was finding the right documents (it was retrieving the correct chunk). Finally, they discovered the LLM was misreading "2019" as "2020" in the context due to poor OCR in the original document that had smudged text. The systematic approach saved hours of random debugging.
**Key Message**: A systematic diagnostic approach can quickly pinpoint exactly where failures occur, turning debugging from guesswork into science.

## Slide: "Check 1: Information Completeness" (Chunking)
**Story Purpose**: Show real consequences of poor chunking decisions
**Story Content**: Share a story about a legal tech company whose RAG system was answering questions about contract clauses. Their initial chunking strategy split sentences arbitrarily at 200 words, which meant important legal clauses were often split across chunks. When lawyers asked "What are the termination conditions?" they would get incomplete answers like "either party may terminate" without the crucial "with 30 days written notice" part that was in the next chunk. This led to incomplete legal advice and potential compliance issues. Only after implementing completeness testing did they discover 40% of their chunks contained incomplete information.
**Key Message**: Incomplete chunks don't just provide poor answers - they can provide dangerously incomplete information in critical domains.

## Slide: "Check 2: Answer Sufficiency" (Retrieval)
**Story Purpose**: Illustrate the difference between relevant and sufficient context
**Story Content**: Tell about a software company's internal documentation RAG system. Developers would ask "How do I set up OAuth authentication?" and the system would retrieve chunks that mentioned OAuth and authentication, but none that provided the complete setup process. The retrieved chunks were all relevant (they talked about OAuth) but insufficient (missing key setup steps, configuration details, or code examples). Developers would get frustrated because the system seemed to "know" about OAuth but couldn't provide actionable guidance. The team discovered that while their relevance rate was 85%, their sufficiency rate was only 45%, explaining why users were unsatisfied despite technically correct retrievals.
**Key Message**: Relevance without sufficiency leads to frustrating user experiences where the system seems knowledgeable but unhelpful.

## Slide: "Check 3: Confident Hallucination" (Generation)
**Story Purpose**: Demonstrate the danger of authoritative-sounding but false information
**Story Content**: Share a story about a financial services RAG system that was providing investment advice. When asked about specific fund performance metrics that weren't in their database, instead of saying "I don't have that information," the LLM would confidently state plausible-sounding numbers like "This fund has historically returned 8.2% annually." These hallucinated figures sounded authoritative and were within reasonable ranges for investment returns, making them difficult to spot. It was only when a financial advisor manually fact-checked several responses that they discovered the system was making up data. This led to a policy requiring the system to explicitly state uncertainty when information wasn't available in the context.
**Key Message**: The most dangerous hallucinations are those that sound plausible and authoritative, making systematic testing for hallucination crucial in high-stakes domains.

## Slide: "Check 4: Context Utilization" (Generation)
**Story Purpose**: Show how LLMs can ignore specific context in favor of general knowledge
**Story Content**: Tell about a healthcare organization's RAG system for internal policy questions. They had updated their vacation policy in 2024 to allow unlimited PTO, but when employees asked "What's our vacation policy?" the system would often respond with generic information like "Most companies provide 2-3 weeks of vacation annually" instead of using the specific updated policy in the retrieved context. The LLM was defaulting to its training data rather than the company-specific information. They discovered this was happening with 30% of policy questions, undermining the whole purpose of having a company-specific knowledge base.
**Key Message**: Even when retrieval works perfectly, LLMs may ignore your specific context in favor of their pre-training, making context adherence testing essential.

## Slide: "Check 5: Practical Usefulness" (Generation)
**Story Purpose**: Highlight the gap between technically correct and practically useful answers
**Story Content**: Share a story about an IT helpdesk RAG system that would provide technically accurate but practically useless responses. When users asked "How do I reset my password?" the system would respond with technically correct but vague answers like "Password reset functionality is available through the appropriate system interface" instead of specific steps like "Go to Settings > Security > Change Password and follow the prompts." Users would get frustrated because the answers were "correct" but didn't help them solve their problems. The helpdesk team had to implement specific testing for actionability to ensure answers were not just accurate but actually helpful.
**Key Message**: Technical accuracy isn't enough - answers must be practically actionable to provide real value to users.

## Slide: "Weekly Evaluation Routine" (Putting It Together)
**Story Purpose**: Show how systematic evaluation transforms RAG operations
**Story Content**: Tell about a company that implemented the systematic evaluation routine described in the presentation. Before implementing the routine, they were constantly firefighting user complaints and randomly adjusting components hoping for improvement. After implementing weekly evaluation checks with specific metrics and targets, they could proactively identify issues before users complained. For example, their weekly chunking health check caught a data ingestion bug that was creating malformed chunks before it affected user experience. Their retrieval audits helped them identify that a recent embedding model update had decreased performance in their specific domain. The routine transformed their RAG system from reactive maintenance to proactive optimization.
**Key Message**: Systematic evaluation routines transform RAG development from reactive firefighting to proactive optimization.

## Slide: "Your Homework" (Conclusion)
**Story Purpose**: Motivate immediate action with a success story
**Story Content**: Share a brief story about a team that followed the "homework" approach after a similar presentation. They started by picking their biggest pain point (poor retrieval precision), ran the Precision@3 test from the presentation, discovered their embedding model was the bottleneck, switched to a domain-specific model, and measured a 40% improvement in user satisfaction within two weeks. The key was focusing on one thing at a time and measuring the impact before moving on. This success motivated them to systematically work through other components, ultimately achieving a 3x improvement in overall system performance over six months.
**Key Message**: Start small, measure impact, and build momentum through systematic improvement rather than trying to fix everything at once.

## Slide: "Appendix: Advanced Considerations" (Bias & Security)
**Story Purpose**: Illustrate why bias and security evaluation are critical for real-world deployment
**Story Content**: Share a cautionary tale about a hiring assistance RAG system that was helping HR teams screen resumes. The system seemed to work well in initial testing, but a later audit revealed it was consistently retrieving different types of "successful candidate" examples when asked about candidates with traditionally male vs. female names, leading to biased recommendations. Additionally, the system was vulnerable to prompt injection attacks where malicious users could manipulate it to reveal information about other candidates. This emphasizes why evaluation must go beyond performance metrics to include fairness and security testing.
**Key Message**: As RAG systems handle sensitive data and make important decisions, evaluation must encompass ethical and security dimensions, not just performance.
